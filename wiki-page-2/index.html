            what language alone expresses. The design work can be based on a customer's demand,
            a demand that ends up being established linguistically, either orally or in writing, that is, 
            that graphic design transforms a linguistic message into a graphic manifestation.

              <b>Graphic design</b>,has a field of application, different areas of knowledge focused on any visual communication system.
            For example, it can be applied in advertising strategies, or it can also be applied in the aviation world[8] or 
            space exploration.[9][10] In this sense,
            in some countries graphic design is related as only associated with the production of sketches and drawings, 
            this is incorrect, since visual communication is a small part of a huge range of types and classes where it can be applied.   
        </p>
        <p>
              With origins in Antiquity and the Middle Ages,[11] graphic design as applied art was initially linked to the boom of 
            rise of printing in Europe in the 15th century and the growth of consumer culture in the Industrial Revolution. 
            From there it emerged as a distinct profession in the West, closely associated with advertising
            in the 19th century[12] and its evolution allowed its consolidation in the 20th century. Given the rapid and 
            massive growth in information exchange today, the demand for experienced designers is greater than ever,
            particularly because of the development of new technologies and the need to pay attention to human factors beyond 
            the competence of the engineers who develop them.[13]

            <h1>Terminology</h1>
       <hr>
    <p>
            William Addison Dwiggins is often credited with first using the term "graphic design" in a 1922 article,
            [14] although it appears in a 4 July 1908 issue (volume 9, number 27) of Organized Labor, a publication of t
            he Labor Unions of San Francisco, in an article about technical education for printers:[15]
     </p>
     <p>
            An Enterprising Trades Union
            The admittedly high standard of intelligence which prevails among printers is an assurance that with the 
            lemental principles of design at their finger ends many of them will grow in knowledge and develop into
            specialists in graphic design and decorating. …
     </p>
     <p>
            A decade later, the 1917-1918 course catalog of the California School of Arts & Crafts advertised 
            a course titled Graphic Design and Lettering, which replaced one called Advanced Design and Lettering.
            Both classes were taught by Frederick Meyer.[16]

           <h1>History</h1>
     <hr>
     <i>Main article: 
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_graphic_design">History of graphic design </i></a>
    <p>
            In both its lengthy history and in the relatively recent explosion of visual communication in the 20th 
            and 21st centuries, the distinction between advertising, art, graphic design and fine art has disappeared. 
            They share many elements, theories, principles, practices, languages and sometimes the same benefactor or client.
            In advertising, the ultimate objective is the sale of goods and services. In graphic design, "the essence is to 
            give order to information, form to ideas, expression, and feeling to artifacts that document the human experience."
