           <h1>Black History Month</h1>
       <hr>
       <p>
              Black History Month is an annual observance originating in the United States, 
            where it is also known as African-American History Month. It has received official recognition
            from governments in the United States and Canada, and more recently has been observed in Ireland 
            and the United Kingdom. It began as a way of remembering important people and events in 
            the history of the African diaspora. It is celebrated in February in the United States[4]
            and Canada,[5] while in Ireland and the United Kingdom it is observed in October.

            <b>Negro History Week (1926)</b>
            The precursor to Black History Month was created in 1926 in the United States, when historian Carter G.
            Woodson and the Association for the Study of Negro Life and History (ASNLH) announced the second week 
            of February to be "Negro History Week".<sup>[8]</sup> This week was chosen because it coincided with the birthday
            of Abraham Lincoln on February 12 and that of Frederick Douglass on February 14, both of which Black 
            communities had celebrated since the late 19th century.<sup>[8]</sup> For example, in January 1897, school teacher
            Mary Church Terrell persuaded the Washington, D.C. school board to set aside the afternoon of Douglass's birthday
            as Douglass Day to teach about his life and work in the city's segregated public schools.[9] The thought process 
            behind the week was never recorded, but scholars acknowledge two reasons for its birth: recognition and importance.
            <sup>[10]</sup> In 1915, Woodson had participated in the Lincoln Jubilee, a celebration of the 50 years since emancipation
            from slavery held in Bronzeville, Chicago. The summer-long Jubilee, which drew thousands of attendees from across the county
            to see exhibitions of heritage and culture, impressed Woodson with the need to draw organized focus to the history of black people. 
            He led the founding of the ASNLH in Chicago that fall, toward the end of the Jubilee.[9]

            In the Black community, the creation of Black History Month was met with enthusiastic response; it prompted the creation of Black 
            history clubs, an increase in interest among teachers, and interest from progressive whites.[8]Since its inception, Black History
            Month has expanded beyond its initial acceptance in educational establishments. Carter Woodson's organization, now known as the 
            Association for the Study of African American Life and History (ASALH), designates a theme each year.[17] For example, "Black 
            Health and Wellness" in 2022 focused on medical scholars, health care providers, and health outcomes.[18] The Wall Street
            Journal describes Black History Month as "a time when the culture and contributions of African Americans take center stage"
            in a variety of cultural institutions, including theaters, libraries, and museums.[19]

            In the United Kingdom, Black History Month was first celebrated in October 1987[26] The year of 1987, recognized as the African Jubilee,
            coincidentally the year of the 150th anniversary of Caribbean emancipation, the centenary of the birth of Marcus Garvey and the 25th 
            anniversary of the Organization of African Unity, an institution dedicated to advancing the progress of African states.[27]
            Black History Month in the UK was organised through the leadership of Ghanaian analyst Akyaaba Addai-Sebo, who had served 
            as a coordinator of special projects for the Greater London Council (GLC) and created a collaboration to get it underway.[28]
            [29] The first Black History Month celebration in the UK was held in London on October 1, 1987, when Dr. Maulana Karenga from 
            The US was invited to an event by the Greater London Council about Black people's contributions to history.[30]

            In 1995, after a motion by politician Jean Augustine, representing the riding of Etobicoke—Lakeshore in Ontario,
           Canada's House of Commons officially recognized February as Black History Month (French: Mois de l'histoire des Noirs
           ) and honored Black Canadians.[33] In 2008, Senator Donald Oliver moved to have the Senate officially recognize Black History Month, 
           which was unanimously approved.[5]

    Ireland's Great Hunger Institute, at Quinnipiac University in Connecticut, notes: "Black History Month Ireland was initiated in Cork in 2010.
     This location seems particularly appropriate as, in the 19th century, the city was a leading center of abolition, and the male and female 
     anti-slavery societies welcomed several black abolitionists to lecture there, including Charles Lenox Remond and Frederick Douglass."[35]
